# 🧠 Mnemosyne — Organizational Intelligence OS

[Insert logo here]

**Mnemosyne** is an **AI-powered Organizational Intelligence Operating System** designed to become the *memory, filter, and coordination layer* of a company.

It is not a chatbot.  
It is not a productivity tool.  

Mnemosyne acts as a **Superhuman AI Chief of Staff**, helping organizations think, decide, and align with clarity.

## 🌍 The Problem

Modern organizations generate massive amounts of information across:

- Meetings  
- Chats  
- Emails  
- Documents  
- Voice notes  
- Dashboards  

Yet they lack:
- A single source of truth  
- Visibility into how knowledge flows  
- Awareness of who knows what (and who doesn’t)  
- Protection against overload and contradictions  

As a result:
- Decisions become fragmented  
- Knowledge is duplicated or lost  
- People are overwhelmed or excluded  
- Alignment slows execution  

---

## 🎯 The Vision

Mnemosyne creates **organizational intelligence** by:

- Mapping how information flows across teams  
- Maintaining a living, versioned source of truth  
- Routing information only to the people who need it  
- Detecting conflicts, risks, and second-order effects  
- Preserving organizational memory over time  

The goal is **better communication, not more communication**.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### 1. Organizational Knowledge Graph

A continuously updated graph that connects:
- People  
- Teams  
- Topics  
- Decisions  
- Ideas  
- Dependencies  

This graph reveals:
- Ownership and accountability  
- Information bottlenecks  
- Knowledge duplication  
- Areas of misalignment  

---

### 2. Living Source of Truth

All decisions and ideas are:
- Structured  
- Versioned  
- Traceable  
- Contextualized  

Every change answers:
- What changed?  
- Why did it change?  
- Who is affected?  
- What was the previous truth?  

---

### 3. Agentic AI Architecture

Mnemosyne operates through cooperating AI agents:

- **Memory Agent** → preserves organizational history  
- **Coordinator Agent** → routes information intelligently  
- **Critic Agent** → detects conflicts and contradictions  
- **Summarizer Agent** → transforms raw input into structured knowledge  

This enables the system to reason, not just respond.
